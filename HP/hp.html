      <p>&emsp;&emsp; As a group of modern scientists, we have a desire to promote knowledge and new ideas. Human practice is a way of showing our passion out of the lab. Reaching out to different groups of people, we successfully share the concept of our project and the goal of iGEM to the public. Moreover, through the feedback, our project became more diverse and more productive. Also, this year, we joined several public science affairs and conferences, held a summer biology science camp, reached out to numerous iGEM teams around the world and experts, NGOs. Their opinions became a crucial part of our project. As an iGEM team, we have benefited a lot by doing human practices. It not only makes our project whole but inspires us a lot to make our project even better!</p>
