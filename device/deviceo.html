        <p>&emsp;&emsp; To bring E. Phoenix to everyday life, we need to provide a workspace that enables our biology part to work safe and efficient. Therefore, Detector EP was born, a device that integrates sensors, incubating platform, and biosafety design. Besides, we construct a web page to showcase the results collected by Detector EP. Combining with our Mutagenicity Prediction AI, users can get all the information about the testing target with a few clicks on the Internet. Furthermore, we developed an education that can turn mutagenicity results in a race car game, which makes our concept easy-understanding and fun. Behind all these parts is an IoT system that formed our system structure, and brought everything together.</p>
