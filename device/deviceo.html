        <p>&emsp;&emsp; We are trying to do our best to serve our target client by creating a easy-to-use danger detector. The “Detector E.P ” is capable of recording the RFP development process of the detected sample. In order to reach the goal of low-cost, mobile, light and useful, we built the device by using 3D printer and parts which can be bought in hardware store. With three simple steps, users can easily get the mutagenicity of the detected sample from a webpage.</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp; “Detector E.P”, a sensor box which can help people to acknowledge how dangerous the environment they stay is. With “Detector E.P”, users only need to do three steps. First, Put the designed E Coli in to the device. Second, put the untested sample and IPTG in device in order to  react with E Coli. Third, waiting for the result that is delivered to the website we built.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp; Though the “Detector E.P” looks simply looks like a box with sensor and internet boards, the techs are in the cloud and update online. There are three services we use: IoTTalk, machine learning, python based web page.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp; IoTTalk is a IoT API service created by NCTU. The main purpose of this system is assisting users while manipulating multiple IoT devices.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp; Machine learning: our drylab crew created a model calculating the mutagenicity through RFP development time lag. For more information, <a  style="color:#cc4932"href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:NCTU_Formosa/Model">Model</a>.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; Web page: to fulfill the user friendliness, we wrote a web page base on python with the “flask” framework.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; Surely our ambition won’t stop here. We extend our system to promote the idea of gene mutation by visualizing the mutagenicity data. There is a car racing game we create, combining all our techs and toy cars. With this game in the field, the public would be more aware of the danger. And can easily understand the fact that different mutagens have different mutagenicities----and how different they are.</p>
